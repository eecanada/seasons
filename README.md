# Description 

* Seasons is a react application that determines whether is it summer or winter using the Geolocation API.
 
* Using the Geolocation API, I grab the latitude to determine whether the user resides on the northern or southern hemisphere. 
 
* Depending on the current month and location, the app determines whether it is summer or winter.


# Technologies Used

# Getting Started

* While the app waits for a response the user will view a loading spinner until they either approve or reject the location request.
 
* User loads application and is asked by browser if they can accept location request, if rejected an error message will be rendered on the UI explaining to the user what happened.
 
* If the user accepts the location request the UI will change to either a winter themed UI or summer themed UI, based on the current userâ€™s location.
